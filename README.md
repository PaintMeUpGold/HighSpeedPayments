MVC 4 Sample app demonstrating calculation of something.
It's by no means ready for production, it's merely meant to demonstrate I could write an MVC app.

Open business-type questions:
1. Requirements only mention calculating benefit cost associated with an employee, not how the benefit cost
   affects the employees take-home pay, so not sure I needed the "employee makes this much per check and gets paid
   this much per pay period" spec.
2. How many users will be using this at a given time?  Right now it's not so scalable.
